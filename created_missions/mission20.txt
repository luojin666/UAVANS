Here's a flight plan in pseudo-language based on the mission description and the identified objects:

```
arm throttle
takeoff 100

// Fly to and circle around each building at 100m height
mode guided(42.78379445833333, -85.55262111111111, 100)
mode circle
mode guided(42.784065013888885, -85.55214888888888, 100)

// Return to home and land
mode rtl

```

Notes:
1. The flight plan assumes the first take-off point is the home location (though this isn't specified in the input)
2. Each building is visited in sequence at 100m altitude
3. The quadcopter circles each building before proceeding to the next
4. Finally returns to home and disarms
5. The coordinates are used exactly as provided in the input
6. The order follows the numerical sequence of the buildings (1-9)
