Here's a flight plan in pseudo-language based on your mission description and the identified objects:

```
// Arm and take off to 100m
arm throttle
takeoff 100

// Fly to each building and circle around it
mode guided 42.801159075 -85.67221990277778 100
mode circle
mode guided 42.798606525 -85.67085790277778 100
mode circle
mode guided 42.80121309722222 -85.67075386111111 100
mode circle
mode guided 42.80021368611111 -85.67066873611111 100
mode circle
mode guided 42.80223951944444 -85.67064981944445 100
mode circle
mode guided 42.80121309722222 -85.66985531944445 100
mode circle

// Return to home and land
mode rtl
disarm
```

Notes:
1. The flight plan assumes the first waypoint is the take-off point (home position)
2. Each building is visited in sequence at 100m altitude
3. The quadcopter circles each building before proceeding to the next
4. After completing all building inspections, it returns to home and lands
5. You may want to adjust the order of buildings for optimal flight path efficiency
6. The coordinates are used exactly as provided in the input
