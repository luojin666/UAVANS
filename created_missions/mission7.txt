Notes:
1. The drone will maintain 100m altitude throughout all guided waypoints (as specified in the mission)
2. Each building is visited in sequence with a circle observation
3. The drone returns to the take-off point (home) at the end
4. The order of buildings follows the numbering in your input (1-7)
5. You may want to adjust the circle duration or add delays between commands depending on your specific requirements
