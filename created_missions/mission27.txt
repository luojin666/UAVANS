Here's a flight plan in pseudo-language based on your mission description and the identified objects:

```
arm throttle
takeoff 100

// Fly to buildingtake-off point_1 and circle
mode guided(42.76553433333334, -85.66983514166667, 100)
mode circle

// Fly to buildingtake-off point_2 and circle
mode guided(42.76394743055556, -85.66724508055556, 100)
mode circle

// Fly to buildingtake-off point_3 and circle
mode guided(42.76182705833334, -85.66719781666667, 100)
mode circle

// Fly to buildingtake-off point_4 and circle
mode guided(42.765297986111115, -85.66673463055557, 100)
mode circle

// Fly to buildingtake-off point_5 and circle
mode guided(42.76256986388889, -85.6661674638889, 100)
mode circle

// Fly to buildingtake-off point_6 and circle
mode guided(42.76182705833334, -85.6653167138889, 100)
mode circle

// Fly to buildingtake-off point_7 and circle
mode guided(42.76641894722223, -85.66410675833333, 100)
mode circle

// Return to home (assuming first point is home)
mode rtl
disarm
```

Notes:
1. The flight plan assumes the first point (buildingtake-off point_1) is the home/take-off location
2. Each building is visited in order, maintaining 100m altitude
3. The quadcopter circles each building before proceeding to the next
4. After visiting all buildings, it returns to home and lands
5. You may want to adjust the order of buildings for optimal path efficiency
