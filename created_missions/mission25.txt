Here's a flight plan in pseudo-language based on the mission description and the identified objects:

```
arm throttle
takeoff 100

// Fly to building 1 and circle it
mode guided 42.88948169444444 -85.30845056666666 100
mode circle

// Fly to building 2 and circle it
mode guided 42.889447777777775 -85.30603563333332 100
mode circle

// Fly to building 3 and circle it
mode guided 42.89032961111111 -85.30579979999999 100
mode circle

// Fly to building 4 and circle it
mode guided 42.889047561111106 -85.30579979999999 100
mode circle

// Fly to building 5 and circle it
mode guided 42.89002436111111 -85.30485646666666 100
mode circle

// Fly to building 6 and circle it
mode guided 42.88964449444444 -85.30363956666666 100
mode circle

// Return to home and land
mode rtl
disarm
```

Notes:
1. The flight plan assumes the take-off point is at one of the building coordinates (though not specified which one)
2. Each building is visited in sequence at 100m altitude
3. The quadcopter circles each building before proceeding to the next
4. After all buildings are visited, it returns to home (take-off point) and lands
5. You may want to add delays or adjust the order of buildings for optimal path if needed
